2.Code Introduction
==========================================
/data is the experiment corpus.

/result are experiment results.

/train are experiment models.

/GPT is the GPT3.5 model and result.

FGM.py, FSGM.py, NP-GD, and PGD are adversarial training methods.

3.Experiment
==========================================
We have sorted out the code and corpus. You just:

1: Just run "./eval.py" to get the paper results.

2: Just run "./train/run.py" to rerun the experiment.

4.Others
==========================================
The README_add include detailed comparison results and some theories about data augmentation.
